If I make the web module the default, I can't route to the endpoint module via dispatch.xml. This is because endpoints (apparently) need to live at /_ah/api and its not possible to route this away from the default module.The other alternative is putting the endpoint module as the default module, however I don't then know how to route everything but /_ah/api/ to the web module. It seems that you can't route /* away from the default module.EDIT: Note I want to have both modules running off of the same custom domain.EDIT2: Note this is single page app. The front end module is purely html, css and js, which I want to talk to the endpoint module on the same domain.Any way to solve this?\n",

I did the following:Included jQuery (latest version) in the <head>Included a jQuery plugin called Scrollify before </body>Included the plugin's initialization code in a script tag after the plugin load and before </body>However, no matter what I do, I keep getting the error Uncaught TypeError: $.scrollify is not a function(ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦). I know that this usually occurs when the load order is incorrect, but I've tried everything that I can think of, even using Shopify script_tag to load the script locally, and using $.getScript(\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/scrollify/1.0.5/jquery.scrollify.js\"); right before I run the initialization code.I see this plugin file loading in both the Sources tab and the Network tab of Chrome Dev Tools. It is there, there is no doubt about it.Nothing seems to work and resolve the TypeError. If I run $.getScript(\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/scrollify/1.0.5/jquery.scrollify.js\"); in the Chrome Dev Tools console, it will load correctly. Then, I can run the plugin initialization code in the console, and it works perfectly. Actually looks pretty cool, to be honest.So I've narrowed it down to being an issue of the script somehow being loaded in the wrong order (considering I can see it fine in the Dev Tools, so it seems to load in the first place). But after trying everything I can think of, I'm at a loss. Besides trying both locally hosting the file and using a CDN, using three different methods for loading the file, and having it in different parts of the page, I can't think of any other way to troubleshoot this. I've even tried a three-second delay before running the initialization code with the same error. Even including the plugin code itself in the page itself results in the same error.One odd unrelated thing happening is that if I don't include jQuery, it will behave as if I didn't include jQuery (as expected). Then I include jQuery using a <script> tag, and it loads fine. But in the console, it says it is version 2.2.3, when the tag loads 3.1.1. It is only loaded once.Any ideas?\n",
